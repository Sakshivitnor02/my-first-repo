    <p>Information texts can be written on a variety of different topics, from natural features and locations to historical figures and events. We encounter them in our everyday lives whenever we read something that provides us with information. Information texts help us to learn more about the world around us. While fiction texts let us explore our imaginations, non-fiction information texts expand our knowledge of our world.</p>
